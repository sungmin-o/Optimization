# Optimized Fully Connected Layer in Neural Network

This is my first project to optimize some programming code.

I started this project as part of Professor Jeong's "Computer Systems" course and achieved 1st place on the leaderboard. By optimizing matrix multiplication, I was able to increase performance from 200 MFLOPS to 44,000 MFLOPS (a 200x improvement). Through this project, I learned various optimization techniques such as SIMD parallelization, loop unrolling, and more. I'm very proud to include this project in my portfolio.
